Will mark stone-chunks to be hauled when they spawn from mining.
I just got tired of random chunks laying about, slowing down my miners.
Should work on any chunk, vanilla and modded.
Safe to add/remove anytime

- Added support for [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1776143665](Raise The Roof)
- Added support for drone-mining in most droid-mods.

### Deep drill

Chunks spawn on a random place around the miner there is no simple way of knowing if they spawned from the miner.
You can however solve it pretty simple by adding a stockpile-zone around the drill that do not accept anything. Any chunk that spawns will then be in the "wrong" zone and will be hauled directly.
