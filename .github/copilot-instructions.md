# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Haul Mined Chunks

## Mod Overview and Purpose

**Mod Name**: Haul Mined Chunks

**Description**: The `Haul Mined Chunks` mod for RimWorld is designed to enhance the player's experience by automating the process of hauling stone chunks that are generated during mining. This is particularly useful for players who find manually hauling chunks to be tedious and inefficient. With this mod, stone chunks are automatically marked for hauling when they are spawned by mining, thereby streamlining the workflow and allowing miners to work without unnecessary interruptions. 

**Compatibility**: The mod supports both vanilla chunks and those added by other mods. It can be safely added or removed at any time during gameplay.

## Key Features and Systems

- **Automatic Chunk Hauling**: As soon as chunks are spawned from mining, they are marked to be hauled into storage areas.
- **Mod Compatibility**: 
  - **Raise The Roof**
  - **Vanilla Factions Expanded - Insectoids 2**
  - **ABF: Artificial Beings Framework**
  - **Ancient Mining Industry**
  - **Project RimFactory Revived**
  - **Drone-Mining** in various droid-mods.
  - Chunks generated by creatures from Vanilla Framework Expanded-based mods.
  - Chunks produced by the **Deep Drill** mechanism.

## Coding Patterns and Conventions

- **Class Naming**: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `HaulMinedChunks`, `CompDeepDrillAutomated_dropProduct`).
- **Method Naming**: Use PascalCase for method names. Ensure each method has a clear and distinct function.
- **Code Organization**: Separate files by feature or patch to maintain clarity.
- **Access Modifiers**: Use `public`, `internal`, and `private` appropriately to encapsulate functionality and limit the exposure of classes and methods.

## XML Integration

- Utilize XML definitions for integration with RimWorld's data-driven systems. Include relevant mod dependencies and patches within your `About.xml` file.
- Ensure XML compatibility for defining custom chunk-related processes and interactions.

## Harmony Patching

The mod uses Harmony to patch the game’s methods, allowing for efficient alteration of RimWorld’s base behavior without modifying the original game files.

- **Key Classes for Patching**:
  - `Mineable_TrySpawnYield`: Patches the method responsible for the yield after mining to ensure hauling flags are added.
  - `CompDeepDrill_TryProducePortion`: Adjusts the production portion to include haul markers.
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Use descriptive class and method names for patches.
  - Isolate patches to minimize conflicts with other mods.

## Suggestions for Copilot

1. **Boost Mod Integration**: For new features, Copilot can help suggest code patterns aligning with existing mod implementations. Use comments within the code to signal to Copilot where assistance is needed.
   
2. **Enhance Error Handling**: Request Copilot to suggest best practices for catching and logging errors during the execution of hauling processes.

3. **Streamline XML Definitions**: Allow Copilot to automate repetitive XML structuring tasks, ensuring all necessary mod dependencies are clearly stated.

4. **Optimize Patching**: Copilot can assist in identifying optimized patch insertion points, making the code lean and efficient.

Please ensure that all Copilot suggestions are reviewed thoroughly for efficiency and compatibility within the RimWorld modding framework. Always test changes to maintain the stability and functionality of the mod.
